# Epileptic Seizure Detection
This is a 5-class classification problem. The pattern here is essentially an EEG recording from which a 178-dimensional feature vector is extracted. There are five classes here:
* Class-1: recording with eyes open
* Class-2: recording with eyes closed
* Class-3: recording from healthy brain area
* Class-4: recording includes brain area with tumour
* Class-5: recording of an epileptic seizure
Dataset consists of 11500 samples where each is a 178 dimensional feature vector. The data is in eeg_data.csv. Ignore the first column in the csv file,the next 178 columns give the feature vector an the last column gives the class label.\

Code will be updated soon\
Happy Coding:)
